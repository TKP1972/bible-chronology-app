When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?
Why It Matters
What the Evidence Shows
This article discusses long-held views about the date 607 B.C.E.
with an open mind.
ERUSALEM! A city that has been revered
and honored for centuries. A city that once
represented God's presence on earth. (Psalm
135:21) A city that was the capital of God's cho-
sen nation. It was there that King David, his son
Solomon, and their descendants sat on "Jeho-
vah's throne.”-1 Chronicles 29:23.
Jerusalem was "the city of the grand King."
(Psalm 48:2) But it was not an impregnable city.
It was destroyed. Solomon's magnificent temple
to Jehovah, the center of worship for the Jews,
was looted and burned. Tens of thousands of
Jews were killed, and the survivors were taken
into exile in Babylon.
This was a major turning point in the history
of God's people. The Bible itself gives us a chron-
ology of those events. But when did they hap-
pen? When was Jerusalem destroyed?
The Bible's Answer
Two Bible books that provide chronological
information about the destruction of Jerusalem
are the books of Jeremiah and Daniel. These
prophets of God were eyewitnesses of the
events. (Jeremiah 52:1-5; Daniel 1:1-4) Their
writings show that the mighty Babylonian army
under King Nebuchadnezzar came against Jeru-
salem. The city was besieged, its walls were
breached, and it fell.
When did this occur? The Bible provides two
lines of evidence that must be harmonized. One
is a direct statement regarding the length of the
exile. The other is a prophecy that connects the
length of the desolation of Jerusalem with the
length of the exile.
Jeremiah chapter 25 says that God's people
would have to serve the king of Babylon for
70 years. (Jeremiah 25:8-11) At Jeremiah
29:10, we read: “This is what Jehovah says, 'When
seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will
turn my attention to you, and I will make good to
you my promise to bring you back to this place. "
Daniel, who was taken to Babylon partway
through that 70-year period, believed in this
prophecy. He wrote: “I, Daniel, discerned by the
books the number of years that, according to the
word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, were to
pass over the ruins of Jerusalem, namely, seventy
years.”-Daniel 9:1, 2.
Some years after Daniel wrote that, the Per-
sian king Cyrus conquered Babylon. He then re-
leased the Jews. They returned to their home-
land, which occurred 70 years after they had
been taken into exile. (2 Chronicles 36:20-23)
The Bible book of Ezra tells us that Cyrus' de-
cree to release the Jews was issued in his "first
year" as king of Babylon. The Bible states that
the first group of returning Jews arrived in Jerusa-
lem by "the seventh month." (Ezra 3:1) That
seventh month (Tishri) of 537 B.C.E. marked

The Babylonian Chronicle (B.M. 21946)
states that in his seventh year,
Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem
the end of the 70-year period. Simple calculation
would place the start of the 70 years in 607 B.C.E.
A Conventional Date
Most historians date the destruction of Jerusa-
lem to the year 587 B.C.E. They base this date
on the writings of classical historians and on the
canon of Ptolemy.
Who were the classical historians? They were
historians who lived centuries after the events
they describe. These include Berossus, a Babylo-
nian priest of the “Seleucid period" (c. 305 to
64 B.C.E.); Polyhistor (first century B.C.E.); and Jo-
sephus, a Jewish historian of the first century C.E.
(about 700 years after the destruction of Jerusa-
lem). These later writers provide information
about the Neo-Babylonian kings and the lengths
of their reigns.
What is the canon of Ptolemy? Claudius Ptole-
my was an astronomer who lived in Egypt during
the second century C.E. (some 800 years after
Jerusalem was destroyed). His canon, or list of
kings, was part of a work on astronomy. Most
modern historians accept Ptolemy's information.

Because historians rely heavily on the writ-
ings of these classical historians and on the can-
on of Ptolemy, these sources have been closely
examined. Analysis shows that there are significant
discrepancies in the historical records that these
men have provided. The numbers that they pres-
ent for the lengths of the reigns of some of the
Neo-Babylonian kings do not agree with one an-
other. Furthermore, they do not agree with the
more primary historical evidence found on cunei-
form tablets.1
Primary Sources of Evidence
What are cuneiform documents? They are
records created by scribes who lived during or
near the time of the Neo-Babylonian period.
Many thousands of such documents are pre-
served today. These include the Babylonian
Chronicles, king lists, astronomical diaries, and
business documents. Together, these form a
body of evidence that represents the primary
source of information for the Neo-Babylonian
period.
What does this body of primary evidence re-
veal? The cuneiform documents are very solid.
For example, the Babylonian Chronicle series gives
us a continuous history for this period. B.M.
(British Museum) 21946 is one of the chroni-
cles in that series. It provides the following infor-
mation: "The seventh year [of Nebuchadnezzar]:
In the month of Kislimu the king of Akkad mus-
tered his army and marched to Hattu. He en-
camped against the city of Judah and on the sec-
ond day of the month of Addaru he captured the
city (and) seized (its) king. A king of his own
choice he appointed in the city (and) taking the
vast tribute he brought it into Babylon."2 (Italics
ours.)
This chronicle confirms that Nebuchadnezzar
captured Jerusalem in his seventh year. He took
King Jehoiachin of Judah captive to Babylon and
appointed Zedekiah in his place. The Bible
agrees with this account. It adds the detail that
the siege lasted until Nebuchadnezzar's 11th year
of reigning, which was Zedekiah's 11th year.
Then the city was burned and destroyed.
-2 Kings 24:1-4, 10-17; 25:1-10.
Thus, we have two independent lines of evi-
dence-the Bible and the Babylonian Chronicles
-that can be harmonized. This gives us a time
line of events. But the cuneiform tablets give no
overall chronology for the Neo-Babylonian kings.
It is like having beads but no string to put them
on. The lengths of the reigns of the kings are
needed to establish a chronology.
Astronomical diaries can be helpful in this re-
gard. These tablets contain dated astronomical
observations. For instance, they describe the po-
sitions of the sun, moon, planets, and stars, often
in connection with the reign of a particular king
and a specific year of his reign. These have been
used to calculate the years of the destruction of
Jerusalem according to the modern calendar.
However, there are problems. First, the astro-
nomical diaries are often incomplete. Second,
the observations described can be interpreted in
different ways.3 Finally, it is not certain that the
events recorded were actually observed, rather
than calculated.4
Business documents form the largest body of
cuneiform evidence. There are tens of thousands
of these tablets. They are dated with the year of
the reigning king. When put together, they pro-
vide a consecutive series of years for the Neo-
Babylonian kings. They seem to confirm the
chronology derived from Ptolemy and the classi-
cal historians.
Reexamining the Conventional Chronology
Are these business documents conclusive? Do
they provide a solid basis for dating the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem? Consider the following points.
The documents need to be cross-checked. For ex-
ample, a scribe might write that he was writing in
King Nebuchadnezzar's tenth year. But Nebu-
chadnezzar reigned for 43 years. Could the king
have died and another king have begun his reign

without this scribe knowing about it? Yes. It might
take some time for news to travel. Or the scribe
may simply have made a mistake. Such mistakes
are often detected and corrected. But this is not
always the case. The series of dated tablets for
the reigns of the Neo-Babylonian kings is not ab-
solutely complete. There are gaps. Therefore, we
cannot be certain that each king's reign began in
the year after his predecessor's reign ended.
What if there was a king (or kings) between the
reigns of the known kings? If so, years would need
to be added to the Neo-Babylonian chronology.
This would move the date of the destruction of
Jerusalem from 587 B.C.E. back toward the Bib-
lical date of 607 B.C.E.
That such gaps might exist is acknowledged by
some historians. Professor Edward F. Campbell,
Jr., published a chart of kings and periods of no
known rulers for the city of Gibeon. He states: "It
must be emphasized, however, that these are pe-
riods when we have no evidence. The gaps may
be filled tomorrow by new evidence."5
Is it plausible that additional years might be
added to the Neo-Babylonian chronology? One
respected reference work states: "We are poorly
informed on the reign of this king [Evil-merodach],
for whom we have only two cuneiform texts
The length of reign given him by Berossus (2 years)
and Ptolemy (2 years) is certainly too short
In the past, the reign of Neriglissar was reck-
oned as four years, but now a text has been pub-
lished from which it may be concluded that even
in his accession year he considered himself to be
king." - Reallexikon der Assyriologie.6
The Bible-A Reliable Guide
To summarize: The Bible states that there was a
70-year exile. That is a direct statement. The evi-
dence for this is strong and consistent. The proph-
ets Jeremiah and Daniel state it clearly. It is con-
firmed by the Bible book of 2 Chronicles and by
Ezra.
The conventional date of 587 B.C.E. is based
on the writings of classical historians whose fig-
ures are not always consistent with one another or
with the primary source evidence of cuneiform
tablets. The line of evidence from dated cunei-
form tablets is not complete. It seems to support
the classical historians, but there are gaps. There
are missing kings or years in the chronology.
Therefore, the Bible's direct statement that
Jerusalem was desolated for 70 years is more
soundly based. The weight of evidence-the con-
sistency and harmony of the Bible writers them-
selves-leads to the conclusion that Jerusalem
was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.
