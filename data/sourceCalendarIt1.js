CALENDAR
A calendar is an orderly system of dividing time into years, months, weeks, and days. Long before
man's creation, God provided the basis for such measuring of time. Genesis 1:14, 15 tells us that
one of the purposes of the "luminaries in the expanse of the heavens" is that they might serve for
"seasons and for days and years." The solar day, the solar year, and the lunar month are thus
natural divisions of time, governed respectively by the daily turning of the earth on its axis, by its
annual orbit around the sun, and by the monthly phases of the moon in its relation to earth and sun.
The division of time into weeks and the division of the day into hours, on the other hand, are
arbitrary ones.
From the first man Adam forward, time has been measured in terms of years. Thus, Adam was
"a hundred and thirty years” of age when he became father to Seth.-Ge 5:3.
Monthly divisions also came into use. By the time of the Flood we find time divided into months of
30 days, since a period of 5 months is shown to equal 150 days. (Ge 7:11, 24; 8:3, 4) The same
record also indicates that Noah divided the year into 12 months. -See YEAR.
Seven-day periods are mentioned at this time and may even have been in regular use since early
in human history. (Ge 7:4, 10; 8:10, 12) There is, however, no evidence of a divinely required weekly
Sabbath observance by man until God's positive instructions to Israel following their Exodus from
Egypt. See WEEK.
Various calendar systems have been developed by men in the past, and a number continue in
use today. Early calendars were mainly lunar calendars, that is, the months of the year were counted
by complete cycles of the moon, as, for example, from one new moon to the next new moon. On
the average, such lunation takes about 29 days, 12 hours, and 44 minutes. The months were usually
counted as of either 29 or 30 days, but in the Bible record the term "month" generally means 30
days. Compare De 21:13; 34:8; also Re 11:2, 3.
A year of 12 lunar months falls about 11 days short of a solar year of 365 1/4 days. Since the
solar year determines the return of the seasons, there was need to adjust the calendar to this solar
year, and this resulted in what are called lunisolar, or bound solar, years that is, years in which the
months were lunar but the years were solar. This was done by the addition of a number of days
each year or of an additional month during certain years to compensate for the shortness of the 12
lunar months.
Hebrew Calendar. The Israelites used such a lunisolar, or bound solar, calendar. This is evident
from the fact that Jehovah God established the beginning of their sacred year with the month Abib in
the spring and specified the celebration of certain festivals on fixed dates, festivals that were related
to harvest seasons. For these dates to have coincided with the particular harvests, there had to be a
calendar arrangement that would synchronize with the seasons by compensating for the difference
between the lunar and solar years. Ex 12:1-14; 23:15, 16; Le 23:4-16.
The Bible does not indicate what method was originally used to determine when additional days or
an additional, or intercalary, month should be inserted. It is logical, however, that either the vernal or
the autumnal equinox served as a guide to indicate when the seasons were falling behind sufficiently
to require calendar adjustment. Though not specifically mentioned in the Bible, a 13th month that was
added by the Israelites to accomplish this adjustment was called, in postexilic times, Veadar, or the
second Adar.
We do not find record of a definitely fixed or standardized form of Jewish calendar until the fourth
century of our Common Era (c. 359 C.E.), when Hillel II specified that the leap years of 13 months
should be the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th of each 19 years. Such a 19-year cycle is
commonly called the Metonic cycle, after the Greek mathematician Meton (of the fifth century B.C.E.),
although there is also evidence that such a cycle was perfected before him by the Babylonians. (See
Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.-A.D. 75, by R. A. Parker and W. H. Dubberstein, 1971, pp. 1,
3, 6.) This cycle takes into account that every 19 years the new and the full moons fall again on the
same days of the solar year.
The Jewish months ran from new moon to new moon. (Isa 66:23) Thus, one Hebrew word,

cho'dhesh, rendered “month” (Ge 7:11) or “new moon” (1Sa 20:27), is related to cha·dhash', meaning
"new." Another word for month, ye'rach, is rendered "lunar month.” (1Ki 6:38) In later periods, fire
signals were used or messengers were dispatched to advise the people of the beginning of the new
month.
In the Bible the individual months are usually designated simply by numbering according to their
position in the year, from the 1st through to the 12th. (Jos 4:19; Nu 9:11; 2Ch 15:10; Jer 52:6; Nu
33:38; Eze 8:1; Le 16:29; 1Ki 12:32; Ezr 10:9; 2Ki 25:1; De 1:3; Jer 52:31) Only four months are
named prior to the exile in Babylon, namely, Abib, the first month (Ex 13:4); Ziv, the second (1Ki
6:37); Ethanim, the seventh (1Ki 8:2); and Bul, the eighth (1Ki 6:38). The meanings of these names
are strictly seasonal, thus giving additional proof of a lunisolar year. See the individual months by
name.
In postexilic times the names of the months used in Babylon were employed by the Israelites, and
seven of these are mentioned: Nisan, the 1st month, replacing Abib (Es 3:7); Sivan, the 3rd month
(Es 8:9); Elul, the 6th (Ne 6:15); Chislev, the 9th (Zec 7:1); Tebeth, the 10th (Es 2:16); Shebat, the
11th (Zec 1:7); and Adar, the 12th (Ezr 6:15).
The postexilic names of the remaining five months appear in the Jewish Talmud and other works.
They are lyyar, the 2nd month; Tammuz, the 4th; Ab, the 5th; Tishri, the 7th; and Heshvan, the 8th.
The 13th month, which was intercalated periodically, was named Veadar, or the second Adar.
Eventually the length of most of the months was fixed as having a specific number of days. Nisan
(Abib), Sivan, Ab, Tishri (Ethanim), and Shebat regularly had 30 days each; lyyar (Ziv), Tammuz,
Elul, and Tebeth regularly had 29 days each. Heshvan (Bul), Chislev, and Adar, however, could have
either 29 or 30 days. The variations in these latter months served to make necessary adjustments
with the lunar calendar but also were used to prevent certain festivals from occurring on days viewed
as prohibited by later Jewish religious leaders.
Whereas the sacred year began in the spring with the month Abib (or Nisan) by God's decree at
the time of the Exodus (Ex 12:2; 13:4), the Bible record indicates that prior to this the Israelites had
counted the year as running from fall to fall. God gave recognition to this arrangement so that, in
effect, there was a dual system of a sacred and a secular or agricultural calendar used by his
people. (Ex 23:16; 34:22; Le 23:34; De 16:13) In postexilic times, Tishri 1, in the last half of the
year, marked the beginning of the secular year, and the Jewish New Year, or Rosh Hashanah (head
of the year), is still celebrated on that date.
In 1908 the only approximation of an ancient written Hebrew calendar was found at the site of
Gezer, and it is believed to be from the tenth century B.C.E. It is an agricultural calendar and
describes agricultural activity beginning with the autumn. In brief, it describes two months each of
storage, sowing, and spring growth, followed by one month each of pulling up flax, barley harvest,
and a general harvest, then two months of pruning the vines and, finally, one month of summer fruit.
-Le 26:5.
The chart accompanying this article shows the months in their relation to both the sacred and
secular calendars and also their approximate correspondence to the months of our present calendar.
The frequent references in the Gospel accounts and the book of Acts to the various festival
seasons show that the Jewish calendar continued to be observed by the Jews during the time of
Jesus and the apostles. These festival seasons serve as a guide for determining the relative time of
the Biblical events of that day. -Mt 26:2; Mr 14:1; Lu 22:1; Joh 2:13, 23; 5:1; 6:4; 7:2, 37; 10:22;
11:55; Ac 2:1; 12:3, 4; 20:6, 16; 27:9.
It should be noted that Christians are not governed by any sacred or religious calendar specifying
certain holy days or festivals, a point that is clearly stated by the apostle Paul at Galatians 4:9-11
and Colossians 2:16, 17. The one event that they are required to observe annually, the Lord's
Evening Meal, at Passover time, is governed by the lunar calendar.—Mt 26:2, 26-29; 1Co 11:23-26;
see LORD'S EVENING MEAL.
Julian and Gregorian Calendars. In the year 46 B.C.E., Julius Caesar issued a decree changing
the Roman calendar from a lunar to a solar year. This Julian calendar, based on the calculations of

the Greek astronomer Sosigenes, had 12 months of arbitrary length and a regular year of 365 days
beginning on January 1. It also brought in the use of leap years by the addition of an extra day every
four years, to compensate for the extra fraction of a day in the length of the tropical year, which has
a little less than 365 1/4 days.
The Julian calendar year was actually a little more than 11 minutes and 14 seconds longer than
the true solar year. Thus, by the 16th century a discrepancy of ten full days had accumulated. In
1582 C.E., Pope Gregory XIII introduced a slight revision of the Julian calendar, whereby the leap
years every four years were retained but with the exception that only those century years with a
number divisible by 400 were to be counted as leap years. By papal bull in 1582, ten days were to
be omitted in that year, so that the day after October 4 became October 15. The Gregorian calendar
is now in general use in most parts of the world. It is the basis for the historical dates used
throughout this publication.
Whereas Christians today customarily use the calendar in effect in their particular land, they are
aware that the God of eternity, Jehovah, has his own calendar of events not governed by human
systems of reckoning. As his prophet Daniel wrote: “He is changing times and seasons, removing
kings and setting up kings, giving wisdom to the wise ones and knowledge to those knowing
discernment. He is revealing the deep things and the concealed things, knowing what is in the
darkness; and with him the light does dwell.” (Da 2:21, 22) So, in his position as Universal Sovereign
he stands far above our spinning earth, with its day and night, its lunar cycles, and its solar year.
However, in his Word, the Bible, God does helpfully relate his actions and purposes to such
measurements of time, thereby allowing his creatures on earth to learn where they stand in relation
to his grand calendar of events. —See CHRONOLOGY.

Calendar Months of the Bible
The Jewish months ran from new moon to new moon. (Isa 66:23) One Hebrew word, cho'dhesh,
"month" (Ge 7:11), comes from a root meaning "new,” while another word for month, ye'rach, means
"lunation."
